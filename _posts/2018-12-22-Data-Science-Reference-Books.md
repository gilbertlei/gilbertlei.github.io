## Linear algebra review

* There are a bunch of suggestions [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/prep_moocs/).
* We particularly recommend [essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) (YouTube series)
* [Immersive linear algebra](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html) (interactive e-book).

## 511 Programming Basics for Data Science
1. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
	- The Python documentation is a great resource for learning Python especially the [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
2. [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)
	- "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" is a standard textbook for introductory programming courses. It includes case studies and exercises.
3. [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham (free version online)
	- This is a prominent resource for R as a programming language, allowing the reader to dig deep into R. It anticipates readers to already have some programming background. Its first part on Foundations is closely aligned with the objectives of DSCI 511, and is therefore the textbook for the second half of the course. Gaining familiarity with this book will likely be an asset in your data science career.
4. [R swirl](https://swirlstats.com/)
	- For those new to R who want more practice with the basics.

Here are other resources that you might find useful:

	- If you find "Advanced R" too be too technical for your liking, try this book. It's along the same vein, but less technical.
